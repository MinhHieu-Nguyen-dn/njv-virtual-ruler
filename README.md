## Key Features

- **Interactive Measurements:** Draw lines directly on the image to measure distances.
- **Real-World Scaling:** Calibrate your measurements by providing a real-world reference distance between the first 2 points.
- **Zooming and Panning:** Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the image, and the right mouse button to pan.
- **Save Your Work:** Save your measurements as a PNG, JPEG, or other image format.
